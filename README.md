# image_classifier
Image Classifier Project from Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree

## Summary and Motivation

The purpose of this project was to create an image classifier which could take flower photos and a pre-trained neural network and employ transfer learning in order to classify the different species of flower in the image dataset.

The motivation for this project is to satisfy requirements for Term 1 of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, as well as to practice and demonstrate deep learning skills and transfer learning techniques.
